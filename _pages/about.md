I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment where I study where pollinators are, what they are doing, and how we can help them in a rapidly changing world using both community and data science techniques. 

I am a collaborator on [eButterfly](https://www.e-butterfly.org), an online community science platform that harnesses the observations of thousands of butterfly enthusiasts across the globe to understand how and when butterflies and other pollinators react to environmental changes. 

My research encompasses precision conservation, human-computer networks, and data science. My discoveries have been published in as Science, Proceedings of the National Academy, Proceedings of the Royal Society B and Behavioral Ecology and covered by Associated Press, BBC, CBC, National Geographic and Smithsonian Magazine.

I teach RNR 150 _Sustainable Earth_, WFSC 223 _Dealing with Data in the Wild_, and RNR 620 _Working with Ecological Data in R_.
